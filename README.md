# InterpretableGCN
  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a state of the art technology. This is a deep learning approach based on the geometry of chemical structure which is called graph structure, and is applied for chemistry, drug discovery, and materials informatics to predict chemical propaties, such as pharmacological and toxicological activity or physicochemical and quantum-chemical propaties.　　
  Recentry, the approach to interpret prediction by deep learning model is in focus. Here I show an implementation of interpretable CGN.　　＼
